## Personalized Restaurant Recommendation System
This project leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to revolutionize the restaurant recommendation experience. Main goal is to enhance the way individuals discover and choose accommodations that suit their preferences and needs. By employing Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks (NN), and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms, we aim to analyze vast amounts of hotel-related data and provide tailored recommendations.

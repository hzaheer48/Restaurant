# Personalized Restaurant Recommendation System

Welcome to the Personalized Restaurant Recommendation System project! This project leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to revolutionize the restaurant recommendation experience. The main goal is to enhance the way individuals discover and choose accommodations that suit their preferences and needs.

## Introduction

This project utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks (NN), and Naïve Bayes algorithms to analyze vast amounts of restaurant-related data and provide tailored recommendations. It covers various stages such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model training to create an effective recommendation system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hzaheer48/restaurant-recommendation.git
   cd restaurant-recommendation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Restaurant.ipynb
   ```

## Project Overview

### Data Import and Cleaning

The project begins with importing restaurant-related data and cleaning it to ensure the dataset's integrity. Columns with missing values are handled, and unnecessary columns are dropped.

### Visualization

Visualizations provide insights into the distribution of restaurants across cities, cuisine preferences, ratings, and more. Explore the visualizations to better understand the dataset.

### Model Training

Various machine learning models, including SVM, RF, NN, and Naïve Bayes, are employed for training and evaluating the restaurant recommendation system.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your local environment.
2. Execute each cell sequentially to run the entire project.
3. Analyze the visualizations and model accuracies.
